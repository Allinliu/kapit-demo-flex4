           description="A wildly bizarre short-animated film, 'Going to the Store', entranced hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube this weekend. Nobody is quite sure what the appeal is here -- some laugh, some say WTF, but nobody can stop watching. Perhaps it taps into some base desire to go flailing through the streets, but more likely it's the tagline -- 'normal guy normal walk' -- that gets you, as does the tellingly subtle ending. The film is animated by David Lewandowski, the lead animator on 'Tron: Legacy.' He created this short for the final episode of Channel101's 'Everything' series, a non-profit short film festival. The 'normal guy' in the film is walking to music by Jean Jacques Perrey's 'Little Ships.' WATCH."
